# T-E-C-H-N-O-Y-O-B-A

Once you get a tattoo, you get asked THE QUESTION a lot.
I feel like answering it, so here's a post for you.

First and foremost, the juicy pics.
No one reads books without pics, no matter how interesing it is.

## The story 

Getting more tatts after the first one is probably very common.
The skin doesn't feel sacred anymore after breaking the seal.
Probably exactly that happened.

There aren't many tattoo masters I'm a fan of - after browsing Instagram for a long while, I found @aztattoart and got hooked immediately.

Having decided I need a sleeve, our initial idea somehow warped into a collaboration with Killkenny, who did my first [torch tattoo](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo083-pnI01/).

I prefer bigger pieces to smaller ones as anatomically adjusted and single idea-centered sleeve in most cases looks better than a dozen of patches.

## Concept

I was always fascinated with technology, even more so after getting my applied maths and physics degree.
It's a way of tricking reality into doing what you want, a clever solution to make possible what was unimaginable before.

One of my favorite things about sci-fi and cyberpunk in general is that technology is the only thing that allows completely new stuff to happen.
[For example, potentially making a God with our own hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b-bijO3uEw).

Think of times when Ancient Greece thrived: the world wasn't really moving anywhere.
It was stable at best, deteriorating at worst.
There was no idea of progress, and the repeated pattern of seasons reinforced the belief of a cyclical nature of the world.

People then believed that the best times have already passed.
The shit was real when their great ancestor heroes performed their epic deeds.
Since then, it only got worse.

But now, everything's very different: we are dependent on technological advances and sincerely believe they will push out world into the brigher tomorrow.

I decided to facilitate on the idea that got me captivated.
Ancient, arcane technology [so advanced it's almost indistingushable from magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws).

## References

Below are the references I consider the most influential.
To be honest, I have no idea to what extent they were actually used, if at all.

I know this one was, for sure:

### A weird-ass boss from Chaos Engine

This pic is stuck as my avatar for at leat 5 years now after stumbling onto it somewhere.
Clicked with me once, never changed since then.
![chaos_engine]({{ site.baseurl }}\images\sleeve\chaos_engine.png)

Later I found out that this is actually a boss from an old game called The Chaos Engine.
They actually have this guy (who's acutally... [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage)?) without all the wiring and cables after the player defeats the Engine.

If you look closer, you'll see the similarities to hair-like cables.

### Doom Eternal's Heaven

Doom Eternal's Cyber Art Deco Heaven immediately caught my attention after the official arts were released.

Some people, including me, had a throwback to famous Hans Giger's works. 
The Heaven had that [creepy and alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-Z4voQic) feel to them I was after.

The Lady is loosely based on these concepts, although after completing the game, I prefer Killkenny's interpretation, at least on my arm.

### Hyper Light Drifter's fallen civilisation

Accoring to the game lore, these are the ruins of once flourishing and advanced civilisations, caught in a bloody war after tampering with the secrets of immortality.

Red circuitry-like patterns are based on HLD designs.
It's curious that they originate from early Islamic patterns.

### Tellurion's Ancestral Civilisation

[Tellurion](http://tellurion.ca/pages/tellurion) is Matt Rhodes's personal project, which I've been closely following for quite some time.

The strange world of Tellurion was once inhabited by advanced people who apparently built fancy spherical buildings all over it.
![tell1]({{ site.baseurl }}\images\sleeve\tellurion_civ.jpg)

Maybe they even created the Robo-Dude, who's one of the main characters in the story.

This flat world has a mechanical Sun, which is sick.
We have a chance to get a closer look at it:

I can't recommend this story enough.
Go check it out now.

# The outcome

It's what you've seen in the very beginning.
Looks pretty weird and surreal, exactly how I wanted it.

It's a very readable and colorful piece and I'm fucking enjoying wearing it.
Also had a lot of great discussions with the authors during the seances, a refreshing experience after chatting with IT folks so much.
